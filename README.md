# qrunch
tkinter for making flash cards out of your quizzes; 
made for crunching from question banks, effectively

## Setup
Ensure to have Python 3.x installed with path variables enabled

After cloning/downloading the repo, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
### The HTML Processor
`compProcessor.py` uses `BeautifulSoup4` to create a sensible JSON file out of the HTML question refernce. The question data is originally obtained from the uni portal as an export of the HTML table. The table's data patterns were recognized to have `<span>` data tags in each table row for the options to a question so converting them into an array of options to a particular question became easy.

### The Quiz App
If your question data file has the answers set already, run `player.pyw` by double clicking it and make option choices from the visible items

Right answer is highlighted green, wrong in red

### The JSON Editor App
If your answers are to be set manually, run `setter_random.pyw` or `setter_sequential.pyw` by double clicking; Select an option and click save to save the option value to the bank file (`output.json`)
You may also wish to manually make changes to the `output.json` file's `answer` field by changing it to a value desired (starting from 1).

Note: the "mark" field generated from setter programs are an indicator of whether a question has been visited.
